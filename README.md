# Webpage-Decoding
First time using the library BeautifulSoup. It was really insightful into decoding the HTML from a website into python.
Documentation was a big part of the process since you need to provide the source.
Most of the data and the brute force is done by the requests library since it funnels all the API easily.
Good introduction into libraries which can lead to many more opportunities.
Run on Python 3.6.5
